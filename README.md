Replace Words
Given two string to find the replaced , inserted and deleted words can be found using replace_words

It will take two strings (example) :

1) String1 = "public and the stock market serves as an interface"

2) String2 = "public and the stock market close as an interface"


Python usage:

from replace_new import replace_words

(replaced_words,inserted_words,deleted_words) = replace_words(String1,String2)


Output:
['serves', 'close']

Similarly we can get Inserted and Deleted words.
